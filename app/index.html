      Hi...<br/>
      My name is Dan.<br />
      I am working as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/virgotechltd">operations manager</a> in the retail industry.<br />
      
      I am studying a bachelors degree in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@danjhobbs/post/C-qjRn5sxA5?xmt=AQGzKngPQAC0kvtyc86MtUy4UR9BeJBOFwKOMbIT6SMsUw">Open University</a>.<br />
      
      I help small businesses with copywriting, web design, marketing materials as Super Tasty Solutions.<br />
      
      I buy and sell nerdy things on the internet as Super Tasty Games on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/supertastygames">eBay</a> &#38; <a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/member/121099431">Vinted</a>.<br />
      
      I post good stuff I find online over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/djhobbs.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.<br />
      
      I sometimes write about films on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/danjhobbs/">LetterBoxd</a> and used to be a regularly
      featured writer on <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/danjohnhobbs/reviews/">GiantBomb</a>,

    <div class="text-main"><b>Here are some things that I have done:</div></b>
    
    <h2><a href="https://scan-dalous.glitch.me/">Scan-dalous - QR code generator</a></h2>
    <span class"subtext">Scan-dalous takes any text or web URL and generates a QR code from it. Scanning the QR code takes the user to either a Google search of the text or direct to the URL. <br/>
      A smaller, quicker web app project to practice a handful of concepts including CSS transitions and keyframes, the Document Object Model, JavaScript functions and variables, adding and removing classes, a very simple API call and some HTML attributes which were new to me. </span>
      
    <h2><a href="https://checkmate-todo.glitch.me">Checkmate - To Do List</a></h2>
    <span class"subtext">Checkmate is a simple, web-based to-do list that stores your plans in your browser. Type in your plans, click them to check them off then click the 'x' to delete them.<br/>
      A expansion in design of the Scan-Dalous with more manipulation of HTML elements in the DOM as well as trying out using local browser store. Learnt a few more styles in CSS as well!</span>

    <h2><a href="https://raincheckweather.glitch.me/">Raincheck - Weather App</a></h2>
    <span class"subtext">Raincheck is a simplistic weather app that generates the current weather and an upcoming forecast in a given location. <br/>
      Similar design to Scan-dalous and Checkmate with a more complicated back end. Takes the manipulation of HTML elements and adds in API calls and more functions </span>    
  
    <h2><a href="https://randomatic.glitch.me">The Magical RandoMatic Roll-o-tron 3000</a></h2>
    <span class"subtext">What do you do when your are running a raffle at the day job, don't want to buy a tumbler and are 
      <i>totally not</i> activitely procrastinating university work? You solve the problem yourself. <br/>The Magical RandoMatic Roll-o-tron 3000 takes two numbers 
      and chooses a number between them at random. Useful for raffles, board games and trying to remember how the JavaScript Math object works. </span>
      
    <h2><a href="https://firstclasspreschool.neocities.org">FirstClassPreschool.co.uk</a></h2>
      <span>A local business needed help getting online. Their requirements were promotion, contact information and a photo gallery. <br/>
        The code written includes standard CSS stylings to match the branding colours chosen by the business as some basic 
        javascript to allow to the user to flick between promoting tabs. The site is responsive to work across desktop, tablet and mobile. 
        As a bonus, I also did all the copywriting, photography & videography on the site. 
      </span>
