# Dan Hobbs — Personal Website

This is the source for my personal site, hosted on [Neocities](https://danhobbs.neocities.org/).

The site is a central hub for my projects, experiments, and personal interests. It acts as a landing page that links to my web apps, articles, and other online work.

---

## Purpose

- Showcase my personal web projects and experiments.
- Share links to things I’ve built, written, or contributed to.
- Maintain a simple, lightweight site that works on any device.

---

## Features

- **Static HTML/CSS/JS** — no frameworks or build tools.
- **Responsive layout** for desktop and mobile viewing.
- **Links to projects** such as QR code generators, weather apps, to-do lists, and more.
- Hosted free on **Neocities**.

---

## Structure

The site is kept deliberately minimal:
- `index.html` — main landing page with links and descriptions.
- `/projects/` — subpages for individual web apps.
- `/assets/` — shared styles, scripts, and images.

---

## Hosting

The site is hosted on **Neocities**, a free static site hosting service:
