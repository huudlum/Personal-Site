# Dan Hobbs — Personal Website

This is a personal website built with pure front-end technologies. It serves as a clean, accessible, and responsive example of a client-side site showcasing a profile and a collection of projects.

Here's a breakdown of the skills demonstrated in this project:

## HTML
Structured a responsive, single-page application using semantic HTML for sections and links.

Created user interface components, including a profile picture, social media icons, and a section for a project gallery.

Integrated an external library for the first time, using Font Awesome to handle the social media icons.

## CSS
Designed a clean, modern interface with a custom color scheme using CSS variables.

Utilized the Box Model & floating for layout and image positioning.

Implemented responsive design using @media queries for mobile and desktop compatibility.

Styled elements conditionally and used transitions for interactive UI components.
